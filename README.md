The object of this project is to help a "local library" that allows their users to
add patrons using the Command Line Interface or a txt document or remove patrons,
display a list of all patrons within the system, manage the list of patrons(by updating 
their information and their fine amount). All data is stored inside the system, not a database.
The list of information the system holds for the patron is:
     - Patron ID (That is automatically generated)
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Street Address
     - Zip Code
     - State
     - Current Overdue Fine

Notes:
    - txt file included in the repository. Copy the file location to upload into the system using the
      "loadPatronsByID". You can always add your own just make sure each item is seperated by a dash!
